# bookdowntargets

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Experimental package implementing the targets pipeline for bookdown
projects as shown in this
[demo](https://github.com/jdtrat/tar-render-book-demo) by
[@jdtrat](https://github.com/jdtrat). There are no promises this will be
submitted to CRAN.

## To do

- [ ] Ensure `tar_render_book()` works for rmd files located in the main
  project directory. Currently, it works as expected when the bookdown
  files are in a sub directory of the project.
- [ ] How to generate an example? Maybe just in the Readme.
- [ ] Unit tests.
