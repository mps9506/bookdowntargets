\title{targets: Archetypes for Targets}
\description{
A pipeline toolkit for R, the `targets` package brings together
  function-oriented programming and Make-like declarative pipelines for
  Statistics and data science. The `tarchetypes` package provides
  convenient helper functions to create specialized targets, making
  pipelines in targets easier and cleaner to write and understand.
